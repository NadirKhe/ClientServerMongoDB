# About the Project One/Animal Shelter Database with CRUD Python Module
Using the provided database of the Austin Animal Center Outcomes, I have uploaded it into MongoDB and included all the screenshots within the README file. The next task was to create an admin account and user account for the mongo shell. The account was only assigned to the AAC database that was uploaded and given the capabilities to do everything it needs within only that database. The third task was used to create a python module that can be executed by other scripts in order to Create, Read, Update, and delete within the animal collections of the AAC database. 

# Motivation
The project is intended to ease the operations involved with the Animal Shelter Database. The setup of the database from a csv document using Python would be an easy method to complete. Using Python as the main tool for the database is like SQL yet can complete more complex functions.
